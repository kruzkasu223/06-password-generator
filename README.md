# 06/27-password-generator

This project is all about creating a password generator tool that can be used to generate secure and random passwords for various purposes.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/). also will use built in [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) for better randomness.
